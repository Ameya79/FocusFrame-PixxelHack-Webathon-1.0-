- The App Wake Up may take some time please be patient :)

**FocusFrame** is a visually stunning, distraction-free timer app built for productivity, clarity, and elegance. Designed for the **ACM TCET PixxelHack Webathon**, it combines modern web UI aesthetics with a lightweight Flask backend — all in a single, seamless deployment.

## 🌟 Features

✅ **Loader Animation**  
A custom animated loader with brand reveal, bouncing gradient ball, and smooth text appearance.

✅ **Timer Cards with Hover Interactions**  
Visually interactive cards for Pomodoro (25 min), Deep Focus (50 min), and Ultra Focus (90 min) — each card animates on hover with glowing effects.

✅ **Text Typing Animation**  
Motivational quotes appear at the bottom of the page using a typing animation to inspire users during sessions.

✅ **Smooth Page Transitions**  
Transitions between pages and sections are animated to provide a polished, fluid experience across the app.

✅ **"Our Team" Modal Section**  
A beautifully designed modal popup displays core team members (Ameya Kulkarni and Dev Shah, IT-B) with smooth appearance and blur backdrop.

✅ **Custom Timer Support**  
Users can enter a custom duration up to 300 minutes and instantly launch a personalized focus session.

✅ **Mobile-Responsive Design**  
Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices with fully responsive layout and controls.

✅ **Single Deployment**  
Both backend and frontend are combined and deployed via a single lightweight Flask app — no separate deployment needed.

✅ **Achievement System**  
Added an achievement section which unlocks more achievements as the user increases focus
